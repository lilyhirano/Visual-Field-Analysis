To model glaucoma progression on the UW dataset, we trained a RandomForestRegressor to predict the mean sensitivity slope (MS_slope, dB/year) for each eye based on baseline visual field measurements and patient metadata. Each eye was represented by its first recorded VF test (baseline mean sensitivity, age, follow-up duration, and optionally all 54 sensitivity points). We randomly split the data into 80% training and 20% testing sets and used a forest with 200 trees and a minimum of 3 samples per leaf.

On the held-out test set, the model achieved a mean absolute error of [MAE_here] dB/year, a root mean squared error of [RMSE_here] dB/year, and an R² score of [R2_here]. Feature importance analysis suggested that baseline mean sensitivity, follow-up duration, and several peripheral sensitivity locations contributed most strongly to the predictions. These results indicate that a relatively simple ensemble of decision trees can capture non-linear relationships between baseline VF patterns and future progression rates.
